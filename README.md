# What is this?

This is a little utility to help manipulate RWD archive files.

The end goal is to get a utility available for those of us in Linux installing games like Kohan II using Proton for Windows emulation. Some games do not work without a little bit of additional configuration.

## Resources

* [Kohan II](https://www.protondb.com/app/97130) entry on ProtonDB. The primary solution requires the user to also have a Windows machine available.
* [Note.txt](Note.txt) file. This was in the archive posted to ProtonDB and has enough details to write code and get Kohan II running!
